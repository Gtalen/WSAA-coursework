    "I started off by forking the Andrew Beatty's WSAA couseware to my repository. Afteterwards, I generated a finegrained token to be able to access and commit changes back to the repository. The first aspect of this assignment made use of the request module to be able to access the URL of the slides folder and the filepath for the WSAA2.1 XML,JSON and CSV_.pptx  file. Once this was gotten, pygithub was utilizd to obtain the content of the file, replace the text"
