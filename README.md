## Description

This repository contains my assignments and project submissions for the Web Services and Applications module at ATU Galway. The aim of these assignments is to demonstrate my understanding of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), particularly RESTful APIs, and how to interact with them using Python. The project demonstartes performing create, read, update and Delete (CRUD) operations on RestAPIs.

---

## Assignments

- Assignment 2:  A Python program that interacts with the [deck of card API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). It shuffles a deck, draws cards, and displays each card's value and suit. This can be accessed here [Assignment2_carddraw.ipynb](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/Assignment2_carddraw.ipynb).

- Assignment 3: A Python program that retrieves the dataset for the Exchequer Account (Historical Series) from the CSO API. The data is stored in a file named  [cso.json](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/cso.json). The program can be accessed here [assignment03-cso.py](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/assignment03-cso.py).

- Assignment 4:  A Python program that reads a file from the repository [Gtalen/Authentication-testin](https://github.com/Gtalen/Authentication-testin/blob/main/ab.txt), replaces all occurrences of the text "andrew" with "ebele", and commits the updated file back to the repository.

## Project - Investment Portfolio Management System(IPM)

This is a web service application for managing investment portfolios, including user accounts, stock information, and transactions. This webapplication is hosted (here)[https://gtalen.pythonanywhere.com/]

---

## Project Overview

The Investment Portfolio Management System (IPM) allows users to manage their stock investments through a user-friendly web interface and RESTful API backend. It supports user registration, stock management, and transaction tracking (buy/sell) which are implementation of CRUD operations using HTML methods. The app is designed with modular data access object classes to handle database operations using python. 

---

### Project Structure

The Investment portfolio database has three tables; Users, Stocks and transactions and the scripts for creating the database can be accessed (here)(https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/db_schema.py).

The database design followed best practices and principles outlined by [(Kumaresh, 2024)](https://medium.com/@saikumaresh/a-comprehensive-guide-to-schema-design-in-sql-principles-best-practices-and-a-practical-use-case-d10f87777cef) and [Microsoft Database Design Basics](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/database-design-basics-eb2159cf-1e30-401a-8084-bd4f9c9ca1f5)

```

The user table was initially populated using fake 50 user data generated with python Faker using the (Faker documentation)(Faker documentation.) [https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/fakerclass.html] and the useful article from (Datacamp)[https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/creating-synthetic-data-with-python-faker-tutorial] as a guide. The individual scripts can be accessed from the (user_data)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/user_data.py], (stock_data)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/stocks_data.py] and (transactions_data)(https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/transactions_data.py) for the respective tables. The stock data was populated using data gotten from (Yahoo Screener)(https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) via url (request)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/stock_symbols.py]


Three classes of Data Access Object(DAO) was set up for the three tables and these were written with Pymysql. (Amos)( https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) overview of object oriented programming provided the much needed insight on on OOP and its Class use in DAO. The DAO can be accessed from (userDAO)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/users_dao.py], (stocksDAO)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/stocks_dao.py] and (transactionsdao)[https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Project/transactions_dao.py].

The main application {"ipm_app.py"} was set up with Flask and the frontend using html, AJAX and CSS. W3 school tutorials provided useful sample codes and foundational knowledge in these languages such as for for creating html forms, tables and CSS styling used in the frontend development.

### Additional Acknowledgement

ChatGPT AI (2025). Used to assist the author with technical explanations and productivity, particularly for debugging and implementing jQuery AJAX for front-end interaction. The scope, logic, and design decisions of the project remain fully original to the author. Some of the Prompts used were;

- How do I implement jQuery AJAX in my Flask app?

- Help me connect frontend user.html to my Flask backend.

- Why is my AJAX call not returning data from Flask.

- How do I use Bootstrap buttons and components.

- Is there a way to use python to generate fake fullname of people?
