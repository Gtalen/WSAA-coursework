## Description

This repository contains my assignments and project submissions for the Web Services and Applications module at ATU Galway. The aim of these assignments is to demonstrate my understanding of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), particularly RESTful APIs, and how to interact with them using Python.

## Assignments

- Assignment 2:  A Python program that interacts with the [deck of card API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). It shuffles a deck, draws cards, and displays each card's value and suit. This can be accessed here [Assignment2_carddraw.ipynb](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/Assignment2_carddraw.ipynb).

- Assignment 3: A Python program that retrieves the dataset for the Exchequer Account (Historical Series) from the CSO API. The data is stored in a file named  [cso.json](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/cso.json). The program can be accessed here [assignment03-cso.py](https://github.com/Gtalen/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/WSAA_Assignments/assignment03-cso.py).

- Assignment 4:  A Python program that reads a file from the repository [Gtalen/Authentication-testin](https://github.com/Gtalen/Authentication-testin/blob/main/ab.txt), replaces all occurrences of the text "andrew" with "ebele", and commits the updated file back to the repository.
